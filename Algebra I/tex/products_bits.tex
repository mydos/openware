% Product

Let $A,B \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{K})$ for some category $\mathcal{K}$.
A $\emph{product}$ of $A$ and $B$ is an object $C$, together with morphisms from
$\alpha: C \to A$ and $\beta: C \to B$, such that the following property holds:
if $C^{'}$ is any object, and any morphisms $\alpha^{'}: C^{'} \to A$ and $\beta^{'}: C^{'} \to B$,
there is a unique morphism $\gamma: C^{'} \to C$ such that the following diagram commutes:

\begin{tikzcd}
& C^{'}
 \ar[swap]{ddl}{\alpha^{'}} \ar{ddr}{\beta^{'}} \dar{\gamma} & \\
 & C
 \dlar{\alpha} \drar[swap]{\beta} & \\
 A & & B
\end{tikzcd}

The morphisms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are called the $\emph{canonical projections}$.
We denote the product of $A$ and $B$ as: $C = A \prod B$ or sometimes written $C = A \bigotimes B$.

% coProduct

Let $A,B \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{K})$ for some category $\mathcal{K}$.
A $\emph{co}$product (sum) of $A$ and $B$ is an object $C$, together with morphisms from
$\alpha: A \to C$ and $\beta: B \to C$, such that the following property holds:
if $C^{'}$ is any object, and any morphisms $\alpha^{'}: A \to C^{'}$ and $\beta^{'}: B \to C^{'}$,
there is a unique morphism $\gamma: C \to C^{'}$ such that the following diagram commutes:

\begin{tikzcd}
A \ar{ddr}[swap]{\alpha^{'}} \drar{\alpha}
 &&
 B \ar{ddl}{\beta^{'}} \dlar[swap]{\beta} & \\
 & C \dar{\gamma} & \\
 & C^{'}
\end{tikzcd}

Once again, the morphisms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are called the $\emph{canonical projections}$.
We denote the coproduct, or `sum', of $A$ and $B$ as: $C = A \coprod B$ or sometimes written $C = A \bigoplus B$.
Notice that all we have done is reverse all the morphisms (arrows) in a product to obtain the coproduct.
This is, ofcourse, the usual method of finding a categorial dual.
