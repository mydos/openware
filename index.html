          <h3>Welcome to Open Course Ware.</h3>

<p>University course notes provided free with original LaTeX source.</p>

<p>
It is quite common for universities to write their own notes for the classes they are teaching.
These notes are then usually published in PDF form. However, it's rather rare to see anyone publish the LaTeX source code for their notes and slides.
</p>

<p>Here is the rational for publishing source code for notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Possible for students to easily create condensed versions of the notes for future review.</li>
	<li>Annotate if something is unclear or they can even replace a proof with one of their own, if another proof seems more natural to them. They can also edit them to remove material that's obvious/known to them, thus making the notes quicker for them to read.</li>
	<li>If a student in the class has a habit of typing up their own notes, they will be able to copy paste e.g. statements of definitions and theorems from the class notes, which will save them considerable time.</li>
	<li>There are flashcard programs out there like e.g. Mnemosyne and Anki that support LaTeX input. Having the source code would make it considerably faster to create cards for e.g. precise definitions and statements of theorems. Especially in fields like algebra, algebraic geometry etc. which have tons of terminology, this could be useful for quick memorization while learning material for the first time.</li>
</ul>
