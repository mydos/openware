TODO: Fix notation here...

\begin{itemize}

\item
Here we shall use the symbol $\equiv$ to denote a \emph{synonym}.
For example, $x \equiv y$ reads "x is a synonym of y" and so x
is synonymous with y.

\item
Here we shall use the notation $[y/x] exp$ to
indicate the replacement of every occurrence of $x$ with $y$
in the expression $exp$ to the right. For example,
$(\lambda x.x)y = [y/x]x = y$.

\item
Here we shall fix the first order logical conjugations and
disjunctions respectively as, $\wedge$ and $\vee$, and negation
as $\neg$. True and False are denoted, $\true$ and $\false$,
respectively.

\end{itemize}
