Two main console environment exist, the textural and the
graphical. In the textural environment we make use of the
shell interpreter to communicate our commands to the
system console. Whereas in the graphical environment we
make use of abstract graphical constructs to communicate
our ideas on what we wish the system console to do for us.

Both environment have various runtime variables that can
be tweaked as needed. For example, in the graphical
environment we may wish to tweak the wallpaper environment
variable. Whereas in the shell we may wish to set things
like the system search path. Various path variables exist
such as where to look for executable commands, set by
\textbf{PATH} or where to find system libraries, set by
\textbf{LIBS}. The details vary and you will need to
consult your environment documentation for the details.
That is, your shell man page or your window manager
documentations.
