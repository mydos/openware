\subsection{Shell Interpreter} % (fold)
\label{sec:shell}

The shell interpreter is the textural environment that
runs inside the terminal emulator. It is though the shell
we command the system console to do certain tasks. The
shell can run more than one command at a time, called jobs.
This is called job control.

\begin{prob}[Job Control]
	Try running the \emph{firefox} command to start the
	Mozilla Firefox web browser and try some various bits
	of job control.
\end{prob}

\subsubsection{Bash Aliases}

Sometimes chains of commands can become quite complex for sometimes
trivial tasks you may want to do fairly often or some common program
may have a obscure name. In this case we may wish to define some
shell \emph{aliases} for our continence. Here is a example snip
of $.bash\_alias$ that resides in the home directory.

\begin{lstlisting}
alias printers='lpstat -p -d'
alias print='lp -o "sides=two-sided-long-edge prettyprint" '

# modified commands
alias diff='colordiff'              # requires colordiff package
alias top='htop'
alias pacman='pacman-color'
alias tree='tree -C'
alias wifi-menu='sudo wifi-menu'

# Tmux aliases
alias tatt='tmux attach-session -t'
alias tlist='tmux list-sessions'
alias tnew='tmux new -s'
\end{lstlisting}
