\label{sec:shell}

The shell interpreter is the textural environment that
runs inside the terminal emulator. It is though the shell
we command the system console to do certain tasks. The
shell can run more than one command at a time, called jobs.
This is called job control.

\begin{prob}[Job Control]
	Try running the \emph{firefox} command to start the
	Mozilla Firefox web browser and try some various bits
	of job control.
