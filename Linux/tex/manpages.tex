\section{Manual Pages} % (fold)
\label{sec:manpage}

The \emph{man pages}, or Manual Pages, are the first source
for documentation to shell based activities. Typically every
shell command has a corresponding man page. If you are unsure
of the detail as to a particular command you should consult its
man page.

\begin{prob}
	Type in the shell, \emph{man man}, to bring up the manual
	page of the manual pages. Another example type, \emph{man ls},
	to bring up the manual page for the \emph{ls} command.
	To quit the manual page, simply press \emph{q}.
\end{prob}
