Introduction to Category Theory
===============================

Category theory is an area of study in mathematics that examines in abstraction
the properties of mathematical structures in concept and how they interact.
This conceptual approach has been of central importance in theoretical computer
science. The study of algebraic structure's in particularly, such as for
semantics-based research. The aim of this course is to give an overview of the
essentials of category theory sufficiently to allow you to go forth and do your own
readings. Emphasis is given on gaining an adequate comprehension of definitions
and well structured examples shall be presented to engage you in becoming
proficient in typical categorical techniques.
